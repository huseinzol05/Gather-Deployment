the point of the article is that while everyone outside of the fox bubble understands that it is an astroturf group funded by billionaires many progressives see teaparty supporters as uninformed low income fools who are working against their own best interest while the reality is that the majority of teaparty supporters are the same wealthy conservatives that have been around since the reagan revolution this is not to say that the media hasnt focused on the image of the ignorant whitetrash supporter with a severe spelling dysfunction

the bible is a good argument against fundamentalism put it that way because taking much of it literally is crazy indeed christian traditions that dont rely on literal textualism are not going to have a problem as theyre already open to the considerable grey areas true faith as opposed to blind belief requires that said penn jillette is as bad a face for atheism as fundamentalists are for christianity as he has very loose contradictory ethics on the one hand he will excoriate people of faith like obama bekjgxveqw3se as liars but then turn around and praise lying in people like donald trump beyjsxah76py as effective manipulators one thing i really hate is seeming intellectual defenses of what really amounts to excuses for any personal bias

it most definitely is how could it be construed as not some form of terrorism they are holding the very interests of america hostage until they get their demands met they are willing to let the economy crash and for americans of course minus the wealthy americans suffer until they get their demands met i hope that history and americans are wise enough to judge these people as what they are traitors in every sense of the word they have turned their backs on their countrys best interests their constituents the history of america and are abusing their positions to kowtow to the needs of the wealthy exclusively that is terrorism ive said it before and ill say it again the gop has done more damage to america than any terrorist organization in our lifetimes yes al qaeda had caused more life loss but the gop has ruined the lives of millions of people and continue by fighting exclusively for the wealthy and corporations taking food from the mouths of the need the elderly the young and the more damage they do the more pride they seem to take in it jesus i wish we could split the country into two separate nations id love to see how long the poor fools of gop land last after they become enslaved to corporations and the rich there would be slavery again without doubt there would be a nation of 98 impoverished all struggling to help make profits for the 2 of the wealthy fuck the gop and fuck the uneducated uninformed people who cling to the both sides are the same mantra you understand absolutely nothing about politics the economy history or anything else that has to do with whats going on right now in america

its sad that lowinformation liberals dont get the idea that stand your ground is the means for poor people to protect themselves from others attempting to bully them stand your ground means you dont have to turn your back on a threat which is often the worst thing you can do having to be forced in the time of danger to try to determine if your back is truly against the wall figuratively in the face of a threat if the situation between the black young man and a hispanic guy were switched and the hispanic was driving the black guys head into the asphalt for no reason other than his own rage the vast majority of america would support the black man using lethal force to save his own life if you arent in favor of stand your ground youre either ignorant or youve got a gun control agenda

i prefer it im a texan and a while back i had a horrible kidney stone but i didnt know what it was because i had never had one before i went to the er in excruciating pain and they treated me wonderfully i got three count em baby three shots of morphine through an iv that is an experience i have never had before but enjoyed and would recommend then i left with a handful of prescriptions after a ct scan is that right some kind of scan and went home and was high as a kite for a few days and then it passed and we were all good again woo so then the bill comes and its 8000 so at first i was all like woah shit so i called and complained because while in the er i had specifically ask repeatedly how much the scan would cost and had repeatedly had my question refused to be answered by the doctors nurses radiologists or whatever theyre called and even the lady who came in to get my personal info and ask me for a credit card to pay as much as i could afford right now i authorized 50 because she wouldnt explain to me what exactly it was i was paying for right now and i finally decided they just wanted a card on file sooo when the bill comes the scan alone was 6000 bucks just the scan the entire rest of my treatment was only 2000 which i would probably have paid gladly after the wonderful care i got and i knew i was uninsured going into this and i knew ers are expensive and at the time i was in horrible pain and scared shitless by it so i didnt care i made my choices and would live with them but 6 grand for just the scan that seemed unreasonable to me and i also found out later that scans like that arent necessary for kidney stones and often arent done unless youre peeing blood so wtf so this is where the fun starts i called to complain about this scan cost i was quite clear that i would pay a reasonable about for my care and was happy with my care but i couldnt afford 8000 total and that 6k for the scan was nuts so they ask me to fill out some paperwork to see if i qualified for financial relief from my bill i explained again that i didnt want charity i just wanted a reasonable bill and btw 2000 for the three shots of morhpine and the 10 minutes the doctor spent with me seems a little out of whack too 800 of that is called an er fee and is apparently a charge you get just for walking into the er regardless of what happens next but hey they took good care of me and i dont know what the fuck morphine costs anyway the only option i had was to file for the charitable relief well ya see i am currently a stay at home uncle my brother abandoned his two kids with our mom she cant afford day care you would not fucking believe how expensive day care is and since i made less money than she does i become the stay at home parent we all live together now she pays the bills and i take care of the kids it was weird at first but its actually kinda rewarding and fun now most of the time so technically im single with no income and have been for about a year and a half now and my tax returns reflect that actually do have some income for contract it work with people who knew me before i quit its all under the table though soooo i got full relief i actually have some money and my mother actually makes ok money and we were willing to pay a reasonable amount for the bill my hope was to reduce it by half to 4k and pay it out over time lower is better of course but i had braced myself to accept 4 grand if i could negotiate hard enough to get there instead i paid 0 and i learned a valuable lesson if it looks like you have no money you can go to the er for freeeeee wee so suck it tax payers i ripped you off for 8000 bucks and i have three pain pills left over for a rainy day now stupid obamacare is going to make me pay for my own insurance boooo thats going to be like 70 a month every month you even have to pay in december come on government its baby jesus birthday fucking dicks
